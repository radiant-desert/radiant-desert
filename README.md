# Hi, I'm aQua

I am a programmer who writes code for practical purposes. I usually work alone and focus on building tools and software that serve a direct function. I tend to work on projects that interest me or solve a specific problem I encounter.

## About Me
- I primarily use Python and MQL5.  
- I also have experience with C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Kotlin for Android development.  
- I am currently learning Rust and developing a web browser as part of that process.  
- My previous work includes websites, networked Python applications using Flask and Waitress, mods for games such as adding multiplayer to Shapez 2, and trading bots written in MQL5 for MetaTrader 5.  
- I write code to understand systems and improve my workflow.
